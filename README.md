# Co-op-Today

I built this mobile web-app in a few hours as a concept. It has the following functionality:

-   Display a list of tasks for the current day
-   Display and highlight overdue tasks
-   Scheduling of calendar events and tasks
-   Provides links to other resources
-   Leave and read messages for each other with photos if necessary
